### Hi there! 👋
- I currently work for **Microsoft** in the [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/) team, empowering enterprises to securely build on OpenAI technology at scale in the Azure cloud.
- I previously worked for [Redpanda Data](https://www.redpanda.com) making people's data go _brrrr_
- Before that, I worked for [Neo4j](https://www.neo4j.com) and often had a few projects I hacked on in the [Neo4j Field](https://github.com/neo4j-field/) project.
- My [🐡 OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org) [commits](https://github.com/openbsd/src/commits?author=voutilad) as `dv@` (or via [FreshBSD](https://freshbsd.org/openbsd/?committer[]=dv))
